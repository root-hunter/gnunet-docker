# GNUnet Build & Release Automation

This project provides **Docker environments**, **scripts**, and **GitHub Actions pipelines** to automate the building, testing, and releasing of [GNUnet](https://gnunet.org), the secure peer-to-peer networking framework.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **not a fork** of GNUnet. Instead, it is a separate repository that builds upon the original GNUnet source by offering tooling and workflows to simplify and automate its release process.


## Release Automation

**Automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions**, designed to:

- Build GNUnet from source on multiple platforms
- Run tests to ensure code integrity and stability
- Automatically generate release artifacts (binaries, packages)
- Tag and publish releases to GitHub Releases upon version bump
- Notify maintainers on success/failure

The goal is to streamline the release process, reduce manual work, and improve release reliability.

## Why Automate Releases?

- **Consistency:** Automate repetitive tasks, minimizing human errors.
- **Speed:** Deliver new releases faster and more frequently.
- **Transparency:** Track build and release status directly on GitHub.
- **Cross-Platform:** Build and test on multiple OS environments.
